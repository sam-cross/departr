# Departr - Train Tracker

I was sick of trying to find a page with *just train times*, so I made Departr.

## Project Aims

* Look good
* Implement backend API which combines current times with timetables
    * Includes caching to minimise server requests and speed up responses
* Remain simple and easy-to-use
* PWA with departure notifications (bell button beside entries on departure list)
* *?* Accounts with the option to save regularly-timetabled journies
    * Email notifications with travel updates
